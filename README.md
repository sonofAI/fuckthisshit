# Typing Speed Tester in command line

### version 1.0:
the idea is to create typing speed tester. for the first demo, i will have 10 words printed out when program is run, and it waits for the continue key from the user, it starts the timer and stops when enter key is pressed, prints out the typing speed(words per minute), accuracy.

that's it for now.

### version 2.0:
- write better wordlist or get from somewhere.

- add command options to run the program, like:
```
python typing_speed_tester.py -n 10 -pr
```
`-n`: number of words to test
`-pr`: wordlist type
